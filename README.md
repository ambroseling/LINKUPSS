# Linkupss
Linkupss is a platform designed to make participating in online meetings and activities easier for seniors. Our solution consists of a user-friendly and intuitive meeting manager for meeting hosts, as well as a physical device called the Linkpad that serves as a one-click-to-join solution for meeting members. The Linkpad features large, easy-to-press buttons with attention-grabbing lights, enabling seniors and those with disabilities to easily join and participate in virtual meetings. Our goal is to promote social inclusion, community engagement, and overall well-being, while providing equal access to technology and services for all members of society.
